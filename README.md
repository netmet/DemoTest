Run the web page on GitHub:


tep-by-Step:
Go to your repo on GitHub
Example: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo

Click Settings (top right tab)

In the left-hand sidebar, scroll to Pages
(May be listed under “Code and automation” → Pages)

Under "Source", choose:

Branch: main (or master, if that’s your default)

Folder: / (root)
✅ Do not select /docs unless your index.html is in a docs/ folder

Click Save

GitHub will generate a live link like:

https://netmet.github.io/DemoTest/

Wait 30–60 seconds, then go to that URL. Your index.html and logo.png will be live and rendered properly.
